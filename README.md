## Dev Server

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Docker

```shell
chmod +x run.sh
```

```shell
./run.sh      # http://localhost:3000
```
or custom configure the port to anything
```shell
./run.sh 8080 # http://localhost:8080
```

`run.sh` will automatically clean up the created imaged when you exit the running process.
